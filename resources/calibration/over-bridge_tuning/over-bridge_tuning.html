<h1>Ironing pattern calibration</h1>
<p>You need to do the filament flow calibration and the bridge flow ratio before this one. It's better if you have done the filament temperature.</p>
<p>This test will print tests samples with various level of obver-bridge flow ratio, between 100 and 125. Choose the lowest value where the top surface is smooth without rough "holes".</p>

Hee, we can see that artifact exists until the over-brodge flow was set to 115. It was flat from the flow calibration, if it's not now, it's because the bridges below the top surfaces are dropping a bit, and so there are more volume to fill afterwards. Here, 115 should be enough, but 120 is a more safe bet.

<p>This test set the setting "complete individual objects" to true, so you may want to reset your print settings afterwards</p>
